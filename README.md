# Important note
**Development and maintenence is now done at https://github.com/europlanet-gmap/mappy  where also further releases will be made available**


# mappy

This repo contains python code to generate maps starting from boundary lines and indicator points. The inverse operation is also supported.

The mappy library can be used as a standalone module for applying the transforms from python code (without QGIS).

The qgis_plugin folder contains qgismappy, a QGIS plugin that implements the GUI for the mappy python module.

**This module and plugin are experimental, please use the issue system to provide feedback**

# Requirements
The mappy python modul;e (and the QGIS plugin) makes use of several additional libraries, that must be installed opf the plugin will not work properly:

 - geopandas
 - topojson
 
 In some cases it might be difficult to correctly install these packages, for this reason whenever the plugin cannot find these requirements it will still load but the main dock of the plugin will be disabled. Map construction will be still be available via a dedicated provider from the toolbox. But deconstruction will not be available.
 
# Install

## a) [suggested] From standalone package
This repo also provides pregenerated zip packages that can be installed in qgis by using the plugin manager.
Download it from [Releases](https://github.com/planmap-eu/mappy/releases) and install using the plugin manager


## b) From repo in development mode

To install the plugin clone this repo in a dedicated user folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/planmap-eu/mappy.git mappy.git
```
 
 and add the following system variable to your bashrc:

```bash
 QGIS_PLUGINPATH=/path_to_folder/mappy.git/qgis_plugin/
```

 or directly define `QGIS_PLUGINPATH` through `QGIS > Preferences > Environment`.
 
In this way QGIS should be able to find the plugin (activate it from the plugin manager of QGIS)


## How to use

- Ensure the plugin was correctly loaded and activated from Plugins -> Manage ...
- Open the plugin interface via Plugins->mappy->Mappy
- Load some data, for example you can use the data in the repository folder "input_data": load contacts and unit_id (just drag and drop the two folders in QGIS)
- You can now execute the "construction" of the map:

- Select the two layers to use (only layers of the right type can be selected)
- Remember to select a field to use as unit's name (or any field that can be used as identifier)
- Run Compute at the bottom of the plugin

## Using as a standalone module
The mappy module can be used as a standalone module in your python script (of course mappy need to be in the PYTHONPATH of your  python intepreter, or installed via pip):

Have a look at the examples folder with an example of processing


This module and QGIS plugin are used to perform the following transform, and vice-versa:

## Troubleshooting

### Can't load plugin 'qgismappy'

* `ModuleNotFoundError`: some of the dependencies are not installed. Mappy uses, for instance, as of this writting _geopandas_ and _ topojson_ which must be accessible/installed to the Python binary QGIS is using. On linux, QGIS uses the Python interpreter found on system/users environment. On MacOS, for instance, the (Python) interpreter is shipped together with QGIS.
  On MacOS, QGIS 3.14, Python is at `/Applications/QGIS3.14.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/`, so to install the dependencies we would do:
  ```bash
  /Applications/QGIS3.14.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python3 -m pip install geopandas topojson
  ```
